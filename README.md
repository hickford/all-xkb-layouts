# all-xkb-layouts

Chrome OS uses keyboard layouts based on XKB, but only a subset are visible (see [google_xkb_manifest.json](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/chrome/browser/resources/chromeos/input_method/google_xkb_manifest.json)). This extension makes all XKB layouts visible in Chrome OS.
